## Introduction to Systems Theory {#introduction}

**Systems Theory** is an interdisciplinary framework that views complex entities as interconnected networks of components working together to achieve common goals. In health and healthcare, this approach recognizes that optimal outcomes emerge from the synergistic interaction of multiple subsystems.

### Core Principles
- **Holistic Integration**: All components work together
- **Feedback Loops**: Continuous monitoring and adjustment
- **Emergent Properties**: System capabilities exceed individual components
- **Adaptive Resilience**: Ability to respond to changes and stressors
- **Efficiency Optimization**: Maximum output with minimal waste

### Health Systems Framework
```
INDIVIDUAL HEALTH
    ↕ (bidirectional feedback)
COMMUNITY HEALTH
    ↕ (data exchange)
HEALTHCARE DELIVERY
    ↕ (resource allocation)
POLICY & GOVERNANCE
    ↕ (regulation & funding)
TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE
```

### System Dynamics in Healthcare
System dynamics examines how healthcare systems change over time through:
- **Centrality**: Key nodes that influence entire networks
- **Sensemaking**: Converting data into actionable intelligence
- **Feedback mechanisms**: Self-correcting and amplifying loops
- **Evolutionary adaptation**: Continuous improvement processes
