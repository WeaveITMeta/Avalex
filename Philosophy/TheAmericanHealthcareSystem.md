## The American Health Care System
The American Health Care System is a complex process that involves the acceptance of a statement as true or trusted. 

Science is a method anyone can use to test a hypothesis. It is a process of inquiry that involves making observations, formulating a hypothesis, and testing it through experiments or other means. The goal of science is to provide a reliable and objective way of understanding the world.

Belief is a fundamental aspect of human psychology and plays a crucial role in shaping our understanding of the world, influencing our actions, and driving our behaviors.

It is important not to confuse science with belief and support conclusive evidence with data, laws, and principles that we know are true. Measurable outcomes that are in direct cause and effect relationships.

Technnolgy can be implemented to accelerate and alievate the process of science and belief. It can be used to educate, build systems, workflows, and processes that can automate a lot of the work that goes into healthcare.

We as Americans struggle with our Health Care System because we do not have a clear understanding of the system and the processes that go into it. We do not have a clear understanding of the science and the belief that goes into it. We do not have a clear understanding of the data and the laws that go into it. We do not have a clear understanding of the principles that go into it. This can escalate costs and increase time to treatment.

We need simply be able to educate ourselves on our own system. Offer valid feedback and make systemic changes to improve the system. If we wait around for superman and he never comes, we will continue to struggle with our Health Care System.

It is time we take our power back and go local.

We design our own system and build it from the ground up.

To use breakthrough technologies like Nexpo, Apache DSync and Nomad Crypto to build a merit based, degree sourced, and accountable system that values the teachings of Jesus Christ. Not some system that embelzes the people and leaves the common people sick and dying to make profit from selling them pills with negative side effects.

Treat the root cause, not just the symptoms.

Therefore, I ask we build a system with artificial intelligence to code our way to freedom, health, truth and prosperity.
