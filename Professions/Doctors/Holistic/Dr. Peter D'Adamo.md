## Treatment Philosophy

"One size does not fit all in nutrition and medicine. By understanding our genetic individuality, particularly through blood types and other markers, we can create precise protocols that work in harmony with our unique biochemistry, optimizing health and preventing disease."

## Blood Type Diet System

### Core Principles
1. **Genetic Individuality**: Each blood type has unique needs
2. **Lectin Sensitivity**: Foods interact differently with blood types
3. **Evolutionary Adaptation**: Diets reflect ancestral patterns
4. **Metabolic Optimization**: Matching food to genetics
5. **Disease Prevention**: Reducing risk through diet
